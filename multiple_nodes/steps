1. Setup the Influx and telegraf for monitoring the data at all the nodes(we use 2 machines). All the data is monitored at first.
2. The data is then exported to a desired location on the system in a folder named generated_data. 
3. Then we host the data on the network using the python http server module using the command:
		python -m http.server 9000
4. Then we expose the hosted server using ng-rok and get the assigned url. These are then set into the host server to get the data.
5. Then we run the write_data.sh script to download the data from the nodes and load into different buckets on the server.
6. Once loaded into the bucket the data can be queried as usual to get the desired data.
